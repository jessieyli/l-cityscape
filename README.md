# L-Cityscape

Group Members: Desmond Cheong (dcheong), Zack Cheng (zcheng12), Jessica Li (jli277), Nick Young (nyoung10)

## Project Proposal (Due: 11/23)

We hope to build an automatic isometric cityscape generator using L-systems, hosted online using WebGL. Some of the features we hope to support include a fully-featured exploration system (including panning and zooming using the mouse/keyboard), real-time or fast-forwarded day-night lighting cycles, and luminescent or transparent texturing.

Here are some reference images that we intend on following:
